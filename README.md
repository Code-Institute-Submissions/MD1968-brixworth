Local Village Site

CONCEPT:
I have recently moved into the village of Brixworth. Being new to the area it is always a challenge to find your feet and get to know where things are. For example: Banks, Doctors, Food shops etc.
Being IT literate, I found myself searching sources like Google & Facebook for locations, opening times etc. This process worked; however, it was rather time consuming. 
 I wanted a different solution. 
I wanted an easy solution that anyone could access with all the necessary information in one place., something that was clear, concise and easy to use.

SOLUTION:
A village website, with links to the local services, a google maps search, and a jobs page.
UI/UX
The site had to be able to be navigated by all levels of users, from beginner to advanced. In addition, all the text had to be easy read, and thought went into the layout to make the site as appealing as possible. I also wanted the site to be viewable from all devices Mobile Phones, Tablets, Laptops etc. 
I decided on sorting the navigation links into alphabetical order rather than what I thought would be the most used options first leading to the least used. I decided against using that order as I throughout the site I have tried to stay neutral towards local companies etc. 
The colour scheme I used was clear and traditional as was aimed at all ages of visitor.
I have also moved away from my original idea of adding lots of photos of the village as this would slow down page loading times and might distract from the information given on the site.
For the links to local resources local councils etc I have used direct links to their websites in order to maintain up to date information as these sites are likely to change on a regular basis. I did toy of entering my own information but eventually decided on using direct links. For quick access thay are listed as drop-down items on the Navigation bar.
FEATURES:
I short history of the village with a link to a more detailed version.
Links to local resources accessed via the Navigation Bar
Jobs page for residents looking for work and a job site search option. 
Google map showing useful places. ATM, Fuel stations etc.
Contact form for feedback etc.
